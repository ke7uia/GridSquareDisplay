GPS to Grid Square Display
This big file did not work for me right out of the box. I had to break this into smaller pieces. 
The first part was to get the GPS to work.
So I found a TinyGPS examples to try. This is found at: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus
The examples are: 
    BasicExample, Device Example, FullExample, KitchenSink, SatElevTracker, SateliteTracker, UsingCustomFields.
I also found a YouTube that helps explain changes that need to be made:

    Once I got to the FullExample, I was reading a whole line of data.
        I started changing things like Location of London.
        I could also change time to local time.
        Then once this is mobile I can see speed, direction, etal.
